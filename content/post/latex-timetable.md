You may want to jump straight to the [timetable generator](#timetable-generator)
otherwise, here's some background on how I created a general purpose timetable
generator for my class üòÅ

Download the timetable [here](/pdf/timetable_csiot.pdf) and the period input
[here](/txt/timetable_csiot.txt).

## An Intro to $\LaTeX$

$\LaTeX$ is a typesetting system that is used to create professional looking
documents. It is a very powerful tool which is used by professionals in every
field.

It supports a wide range of features, including:

- Mathematical equations
- Tables
- Figures
  - Including TikZ graphics
- etc.

You can extend the functionality of $\LaTeX$ by installing packages which are
available on the [CTAN](https://ctan.org/) library.

And most importantly, it is free and open source!

With the benefits of using $\LaTeX$ comes the cost of learning the syntax. This
is a very steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, you will never
want to go back to using a word processor again.

## The Purpose

The timetables that we use in our class are very simple and often not very
aesthetically pleasing. They are very cluttered and hard to read.

Hence I decided to create a timetable that while being easy to read and
attractive to look at also had the ability to be procedurally generated. This
would allow someone to easily create non-conflicting timetables for different
classes and semesters.

## How I did it

The basic idea is to generate a table in $\LaTeX$ procedurally using JavaScript.
You can look at the source code of the timetable generator
[here](https://github.com/ossnsut/ossnsut.github.io/blob/main/layouts/shortcodes/latex_timetable.html).
However as a quick overview for the beginner, here's how you can create tables
in $\LaTeX$.

### Creating a Table

To create a table in $\LaTeX$ you use the `tabular` environment. This
environment takes a single argument which is a string that describes the layout
of the table.

For example, the following code creates a table with 3 columns and 2 rows.

```latex
\begin{tabular}{c | c c}
  1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline
  4 & 5 & 6
\end{tabular}
```

The `c` in the argument string tells $\LaTeX$ that the column should be
centered.

You can also specify the alignment of the columns using the `l` and `r`
characters.

Anyways, here's how you can use the TimeTable generator.

### Using the TimeTable Generator

The form below allows you to create your timetable.

Submit the number of `columns` in the timetable and the number time on which
your classes start.

Specify the amount of time between each class in minutes as the `Time Step`.

Finally, specify the individual slots in the timetable.

#### Period Syntax

The syntax for specifying a period is as follows:

<!-- (MA 5101 > Algebra 1) [A1-2 B2-2 D4-5] -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

```text
( <subject title> > <course subtitle> ) [ <Day><slot start>-<slot end> <Day><slot start>-<slot end> ... ]
...
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

The `subject title` and `course subtitle` are specified in parentheses and
separated by a `>`.

The `Day` is specified as a single character, where `A` is Monday, `B` is
Tuesday, and so on.

The `slot start` and `slot end` are specified as a single character, where `1`
is the first slot, `2` is the second slot, and so on.

The `slot start` and `slot end` are separated by a `-`.

The `slot start` and `slot end` are inclusive.

The `slot start` and `slot end` can be the same.

For example the given example would generate the following table.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/timetable_example.png" width="70%" alt="latex timetable">
</p>

You can generate the timetable by clicking the `Generate` button. The generated
timetable is a `.tex` file which you can compile using your favourite $\LaTeX$
compiler.

I'd recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) as it is pretty easy
to use and doesn't need any setup.

The compiled `pdf` file can be downoaded here:
