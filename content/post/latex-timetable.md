If you want to jump straight to the _timetable generator_ click [right here](#timetable-generator)
otherwise, here's some background on how I created a general
purpose timetable generator for my class üòÅ

Download the timetable [here](/pdf/timetable_csiot.pdf)
and the period input [here](/txt/timetable_csiot.txt).

## An Intro to $\LaTeX$

$\LaTeX$ is a typesetting system that is used to create
professional looking documents.
It is a very powerful tool which is used by professionals in
every field.

It supports a wide range of features, including:

- Mathematical equations
- Tables
- Figures
  - Including TikZ graphics
- etc.

You can extend the functionality of $\LaTeX$ by installing packages
which are available on the [CTAN](https://ctan.org/) library.

And most importantly, it is free and open source!

With the benefits of using $\LaTeX$ comes the cost of learning
the syntax.
This is a very steep learning curve, but once you get the hang
of it, you will never want to go back to using a word processor
again.

## The Purpose

The timetables that we use in our class are very simple and often
not very aesthetically pleasing. They are very cluttered and
hard to read.

Hence I decided to create a timetable that while being easy to
read and attractive to look at also had the ability to be
procedurally generated. This would allow someone to easily create
non-conflicting timetables for different classes and semesters.

## How I did it

The basic idea is to generate a table in $\LaTeX$ procedurally
using JavaScript. You can look at the source code of the timetable
generator [here](https://github.com/ossnsut/ossnsut.github.io/blob/main/layouts/shortcodes/latex_timetable.html).
However as a quick overview for the beginner, here's how you can
create tables in $\LaTeX$.

### Creating a Table

To create a table in $\LaTeX$ you use the `tabular` environment.
This environment takes a single argument which is a string that
describes the layout of the table.

For example, the following code creates a table with 3 columns
and 2 rows.

```latex
\begin{tabular}{c | c c}
  1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline
  4 & 5 & 6
\end{tabular}
```

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/svg/table.svg" alt="latex table">
</p>

The `c` in the argument string tells $\LaTeX$ that the column
should be centered.

You can also specify the alignment of the columns using the
`l` and `r` characters.

Anyways, here's how you can use the TimeTable generator.

### Using the TimeTable Generator

The form below allows you to create your timetable.

Submit the number of `columns` in the timetable and the number
time on which your classes start.

Specify the amount of time between each class in minutes as the `Time Step`.

Finally, specify the individual slots in the timetable.

#### Period Syntax

The syntax for specifying a period is as follows:
<!-- (MA 5101 > Algebra 1) [A1-2 B2-2 D4-5] -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
```text
( <subject title> > <course subtitle> ) [ <Day><slot start>-<slot end> <Day><slot start>-<slot end> ... ]
...
```

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

The `subject title` and `course subtitle` are specified in
parentheses and separated by a `>`.

The `Day` is specified as a single character, where `A` is
Monday, `B` is Tuesday, and so on.

The `slot start` and `slot end` are specified as a single
character, where `1` is the first slot, `2` is the second slot,
and so on.

The `slot start` and `slot end` are separated by a `-`.

The `slot start` and `slot end` are inclusive.

The `slot start` and `slot end` can be the same.

For example the given example would generate the following table.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/timetable_example.png" width="70%" alt="latex timetable">
</p>

You can generate the timetable by clicking the `Generate` button.
The generated timetable is a `.tex` file which you can compile
using your favourite $\LaTeX$ compiler.

I'd recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) as it
is pretty easy to use and doesn't need any setup.

The compiled `pdf` file can be downoaded here:
