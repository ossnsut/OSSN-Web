As you might have guessed this is an open blog where anyone can write about
anything related to open source software. If you want to write a post, you can
do so by creating a new file in the `content/post` directory on the
[_**GitHub Repository**_](https://github.com/ossnsut/ossnsut.github.io/) and
submit a pull request.

You can also create an issue on the repository if you want to write a post but
don't know how to do it.

Take a look at some of the posts that have already been written to get an idea
of what kind of posts we are looking for.
