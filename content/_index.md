We are a group of enthusiasts at _Netaji Subhas University of Technology_,
passionate about everything Open Source.

Not only do we love to code, but we also love to share our knowledge
and experience with others.

This year we plan to hold events and workshops on various topics for
familiarizing students with UNIX tools, Linux environment and the development of
all kinds of software that you are using on a daily basis.
