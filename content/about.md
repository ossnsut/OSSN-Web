OSSN was created to help students learn about open source software and to help
them get involved in open source projects. We are a community of students who
are passionate about open source software and want to help others learn about it.

## What is Open Source?

In this age and time, and the environment that we live in we become absorbed with the proprietary software that we depend upon, unaware of the
technologies it was built upon or what enables almost any start up to be
brought into existence.

Put simply, open source is a way of developing software that enables anyone to write and change the flow of development of the software that they
use and love without extensive and up-front planning.

It is a rather simple mechanism1 that enables the community to work
together to build a better, more accessible and more secure software.

## The goal of OSSN

The goal of OSSN is to create a community of students who are interested in
open source and are able to work together to create something that is useful
to the community.

The society shall be an open platform for everyone. Anyone who is interested in
 open source and wants to expand their knowledge can contribute to it can join
 the society.

While being open to everyone, the society also has an internal team that is
responsible for the smooth functioning of the society which is by
careful selection of the capable members.
